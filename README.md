# dothub
Stop managing your repo and organization config through an UI like a mere human
and do everything through beautiful config YAML files.

dothub allows you to declare your configuration in a config file and update it by
just updating the file. This allows you to configure your labels, collaborators,
default repo parameters and other as code and have it version controlled.
